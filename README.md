Hello everyone, we're looking forward to your contributions to our Android project.ðŸ‘‡

## Description:
We are creating a real-time Android chat application allowing people to communicate securely via HTTPS for end-to-end communication.

## Functionalities:

1. Toast notification when users open the app.


2. Home screen includes Sign In and Sign Up buttons.

   Sign Up: User enters email, receives OTP for email verification, and then creates a password (with standard rules).

   Sign In: User provides email and password. Credentials should be saved securely in the database (hashed passwords).



3. Authentication: We suggest using JWT tokens for secure user authentication. Open to suggestions for alternative secure methods.


4. UI should resemble common chat apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.). Light or dark mode is acceptable.


5. Attachment sending (e.g., images, PDFs, stickers) isn't required, but appreciated.


6. Messages should have different colors for sent messages and URLs (URLs open in the default browser).


7. Suggest optional features like online status and push notifications using Firebase.



## Tech Stack:

Android UI: Pure Java

Backend: Django & Django Rest Framework

Authentication: JWT (or similar)

Database: PostgreSQL for user data and authentication


Feel free to contribute ideas or suggest improvements. We welcome all input.
